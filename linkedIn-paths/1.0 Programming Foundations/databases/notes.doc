#databases


schema -how data in a database will be organized

Pragmatics is the third general area of language description, referring to practical aspects of how constructs and features of a language may be used to achieve various objectives. Consider, for example, the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of an assignment statement.

table-entities

##relational database - made up of relations or tables which are the set of columns, and these tables als contain rows also contain rows
relation - set of columns of related data

*column data types



-unique - unique value is a value that doesn't show up in any other row in a given column. So there's one and only one of any particular value for that particular field. 
-primary -  Unique values can also be used as keys. A key is a value we can use to refer to only one specific row or record.
-synthetic key or surrogate key -  In many cases, there isn't a natural piece of information that can be used as a key, so we need to provide one. We can do this by adding a column to a table and setting that column to require a unique value. In many DBMS tools, this is done by making the value in the new column a number and telling the database to increment the number for every new number that's added. When we add a field like this, we create a synthetic key or a surrogate key
-composite key - two or more fields taken together to act as a unique identifier
-foreign key  -  this is what a primary key from one table is called when it's referenced in another table


##relationships
*one-to-many - one record in one table with multiple records in another table
uses foreignn key


*many-to-many
linking table - contains columns for the foreiggn keys

*one-to-one - only one record on the table wiith onl one record on the other table

##acid & transactions
transaction - set of operations that must be all completed, if fnot all completed, no changes weill be saved

A - atomic - transaction is indivisible
c - consistent - whatever the transactvions does, it needs to leave the database in a valid or consstent state
i - isolated -while the activites in the transaction are b eing completed, nothing else can make changes to the data involved
d - durable - means that the information we change in the transaction actually gets written to the database.


##sql 
rdbms - relational database management system

allows us to write statements which the DBMS interprets, and that's how we interact with the data in the database, from apps, or even within the DBMS itself.

SQL also offers features to manage the database itself by creating and modifying tables and controlling access to tables. In these roles, SQL acts as a DDL or a data definition language, and a DCL, or a data control language.

Entity relaationship diagram (ER diagram)
a diagra that uses tables, fields, and relationships to plan a database

what does your database need tto store
-database needs
 
/tables name capital letters
/?field/column should be singular and upper camel casae

char is usually reserved for fields where wew know we haave an exact number of char
date 
datetime
timestamp


null - absence of a value



referential integrity- databases are aware of relationships and won't allow a user to modify data in a way tha violates those relationships

-helps to keep the database consistent and accurate


## normalization rules
normalization helps us prevent problems in working with our data, and the proocessed should be revisited whenever there's a change to the schema



* first normal form (1nf) 
values in each cell should be atomic and tables should have no repeating groups

* second normal form (2nf)
no value in a table should depend on only part of a key that can be used to uniquely identify a row

composite key

* third normal form (3nf)
values should not be stored if they can be calcualted from another non-key field

## denormalization
the process of intentionally duplicating information in a table, in violation of normalization rules
- done to a previously normalized database
- a trade-off. gaining speed may reduce consistency


## structured query language
- can bee used as a data definition language (ddl) and a data manipulation language (dml)   
   

   sql query time component
   date range


   order by = sort
